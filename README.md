# wp-gofast

Serving WordPress with Go! 

Use at your own risk! :) 

At this point it's just a rough proof of concept, I would like to implement 
it differently. However, I didn't have time as this point and took some 
shortcuts just to get it working.

Also, be advised it has many bugs to be ironed out.
